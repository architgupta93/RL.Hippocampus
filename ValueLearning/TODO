1.  Start with random initial values for the critic instead of starting with
    all zeros.

2.  Add a momentum term to the 'Actor' agent. Instead of relying only on the
    current activity, it has a memory of the past activities and incorporates
    that in making a decision.

3.  Plot the trajectories with the same x-y limits to make it easier to
    visualize the trajectories. Also add markers for the start and end
    points.
